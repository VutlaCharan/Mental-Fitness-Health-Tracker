# Mental-Fitness-Health-Tracker
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker project focuses on analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels of individuals from various countries with different mental disorders. It utilizes regression techniques to provide insights into mental health and make predictions based on the available data.

## BRIEF SUMMARY
- Developed a fully functional Mental Health Fitness Tracker ML model using Python and scikit-learn.
- Utilized linear regression and random regression algorithms to achieve precise results in analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels from over 150 countries.
- Cleaned, preprocessed, and engineered features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Optimized the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing ensemble methods, resulting in an impressive accuracy percentage of 99.50%.
